Moodle 2.5 web services python library

All this project information is available in the Memory.pdf inside Documentation Folder.
The useful programs are inside the MoodProy porject.
The Moodle Python library API is also located in Documentation.
The Project resources folder is for supporting material for the development.

This project contains the description and development process of the Moodle Web
Services Python Library. The initial perspective is to investigate the chance 
of controlling the Moodle system from external applications.
The Moodle web services will be studied for exploiting all its potential.
In this study, diverse information will be picked up for activating and to
configure those services. This study also revealed a powerful utility for
doing Moodle management tasks through scripts.
This project also provides a full functional library of Moodle web services 2.5 for
supporting applications development. This library was programmed in the Python
programming language and provides a communications interface with all available web
services functions.
This library has been fully tested with short scripts that can be taken as use examples.
It also has been fully documented using Python data structures and taking as reference the
official documentation.
One important met goal is to document all the process to use Moodle since its
installation to its final use tests. Some steps taken along the project are documented in
several different and not related sources. Sometimes this documentation is poor or
confusing. This project compiles all this steps details and includes some missing
documentation. This will help to Moodle users that want use this capability without wasting
time looking for use guides.

This work and the corresponding Memory were made for my thesis.
